# Programming Assignment - Getting and Cleaning Data

### This repo is used to submit my results of the programming assignment of the "Getting-and-Cleaning-Data" course for evaluation.

### The repo contains three files:
* the file "run_analysis.R" contains the R code which performs the analysis and returns the results in a text file
* the file "MyOutputData.txt" is the text file returned by the "run_analysis.R" code  
* the file "CodeBook.md" is a markdown file which describes how the "run_analysis.R" code works (i.e. the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data set)
